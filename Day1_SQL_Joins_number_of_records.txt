=============================

Q1)
Scenario 1:

Table1 Table2 
 1       1
 1       1
 1       2
 2       2
 3       4
 3       null
 3

 a) Find Number of records after inner Join?
 -> 8 records will be returned which are matching in both the tables

 b) Find Number of records after doing left join?

 -> inner join + non matching record from left table 

 -> 8 + 3 => 11 records

 c) Find Number of records after doing right join ?

 -> inner join + non matching records from right table 

 -> 08 + 02 => 10 records

 d) Find number of records after doing full outer join?

 -> inner join + left join + right join 

 -> 08 + 03 + 02 => 13 records

 e) Find number of records after doing cross joins?

 -> so it is just like cartesian product 

 -> no of records = no of records from left table * no of records from right table
  => 7 * 6 => 42 records

Scenario 2:

Table1  Table2
 1        1
 1        1
 1        1
 1        2
 1        null
 null
 null

 q1) Find Number of records after doing inner join ?

 -> matching records from both the tables 
 -> 15 
 -> null will not be treated as matching records because two null values can never be treted as same 

q2) Find Number of records after doing left join ?

-> inner join + non matching records from left table 
-> 15 + 02 => 17 records
